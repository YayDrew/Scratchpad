# This is my scratchpad for experimenting and learning with my brother.

### Things to consider:  when working with data (files vs. databases etc.)
# Acid  
* Atomicity: all or nothing
* Consistency: rules will be followed  ex. uniqueness of data 
* Isolation: if two threads touch the same data, who wins? eg. serializable
* Durability: like the pyramids, whatever you change is permanent
